# Economic Analysis Report
## Project Objective
The objective of this analysis is to explore the relationship between GDP, Inflation Rate, Economic Growth, and Unemployment Rate across multiple countries. Specifically, we aim to determine:
- Whether high GDP is always followed by higher inflation.
- The correlation between economic growth and unemployment rates (Okun's Law).
- Trends in inflation and economic performance over time.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/elangherama/Project-Data-Analysis-3/blob/main/Latihan%20Ekonomi%20dan%20Inflasi.xlsx">Dataset<a/>

## Key Questions
- Is a higher GDP always followed by higher inflation?
- What is the relationship between economic growth and unemployment rates? (Testing Okun’s Law)
- How do inflation and economic performance change over time?
- Are there country-specific economic patterns that deviate from general trends?

## Process
1. Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation
   - Standardized data format for GDP, Inflation, and Unemployment rates.
   - Checked for missing values and ensured consistent time series.
   - Removed anomalies or incorrect entries.

2. Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Descriptive Statistics: Checked means, standard deviations, and trends over the years.
   - Scatter Plots & Correlation Analysis:
     - GDP vs. Inflation
     - Economic Growth vs. Unemployment
   - Trend Analysis: Line charts were used to observe the evolution of inflation and GDP over time.
     
3. Step 3: Statistical & Visualization Techniques
   - Correlation Coefficients: Used to measure relationships between variables.
   - Regression Analysis: Tested if GDP has a significant impact on inflation.
   - Looker Studio Dashboards: Built interactive dashboards for real-time exploration.

## Project Insight
1. Insight 1: GDP vs. Inflation
   - The correlation between GDP and inflation is not always positive.
   - Some countries show high GDP with controlled inflation due to monetary policies (e.g., USA).
   - Other economies with rapid GDP growth experience inflation spikes (e.g., Turkey, Brazil).

2. Insight 2: Economic Growth vs. Unemployment (Okun’s Law)
   - Most countries support Okun’s Law (higher economic growth → lower unemployment).
   - However, some outliers exist where unemployment remains high despite economic growth (structural issues in labor markets).

3. Insight 3: Inflation Trends
   - Inflation varies significantly across countries.
   - 2020-2025 projections show that inflation is expected to stabilize in some regions, while others (e.g., emerging economies) might face persistent inflation.

## Final Conclusion
- GDP growth does not always cause inflation, as other factors such as monetary policies, supply shocks, and labor market conditions play crucial roles.
- Economic growth is inversely related to unemployment, but not uniformly across all economies.
- Inflation trends are country-specific, influenced by local policies and external economic conditions.
